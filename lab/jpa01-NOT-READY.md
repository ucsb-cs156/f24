Like jpa00, this lab is a basic "Hello World" lab, but this time for a simple web application.

You'll run your web application in two place:
* on your local computer (we call this *running on localhost*)
* on an actual web server reachable from any browser connected to the internet

For running on the actual web, we'll be using machines with the following hostnames; the machine you use is determined by which team you are on.
