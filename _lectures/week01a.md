# Outline for Today

Note that you can get started on some of this *before* class and you are encouaged to do so.  If you get it all done before class, then all you need to do is come to class (or the lecture zoom room) to check in briefly, and possibly help some of your teammates.

1. Check in on your Slack with your name, and what platform you use, e.g. `I use MacOS`, or `I use Windows/WSL` or `My laptop runs Ubuntu Linux` or whatever.
   * Optional: You may want to rearrange yourself at the table so that Mac folks are sitting with Mac folks, and Windows folks with Windows folks, etc.  This will make it easier if you run into problems later, since you can check in with your neighbor.
2. Follow the instructions at this link: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f24/info/software.html>
   * If you get stuck, check your slack channel to see which team members have the same platform as you.  Try to get help from them first.
   * If the folks are your team don't know, then try the `#help-macos` or `#help-windows` channels. Before posting your question, see if it's already been answered by someone else.
   * If you post a question that has no answer, then copy a link to your Slack post, and post that *again* on help-lecture-discussion.  Include your table number along with the link to your question on either `#help-macos` or `#help-windows`
3. When you are all finished, check to see whether jpa00 (our first Java programming assignment) has dropped on Canvas.  If so, you can get started on it. If not, then proceed to the next item...
4. If you've done all of the items above, then check in with your teammates on the Slack channel and/or in person to see if any of them need any help.  If so, please help them as best you can. If not, you are *free to go early*.
