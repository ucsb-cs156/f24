# If you haven't finished P00, P01, P02, do them now

Links can be found on Canvas.

# When you've finished P00, P01, P02: start jpa00

jpa00 is "Java Programming Assignment zero zero", the first Java Programming Assignment.

It's a basic "Hello World", but with the twist that it's run using professional java tools.

You may be used to doing:

```
javac Hello.java
java Hello
```

But for professional java development, we use a build system such as Maven or Gradle. In this course, we use Maven.  jpa00 introduces you to that, as well as submitting via Gradescope.

Here's a link to the instructions: <https://ucsb-cs156.github.io/f24/lab/jpa00.html>
