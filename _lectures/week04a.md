## Start with Standup

1. First, please take a moment to make a *standup post* on your *official slack team channel*   The post can just be something like this:



## Kanban board Video

Here’s a short video (5 minutes, 42 seconds) that goes along with team01; I recommend you watch it sometime Sunday or Monday.  It has something easy you can do to help organize your work for team01.

I suggest you try to complete at least one issue per day starting today; it will be much easier to finish the project by the deadlilne if you do that!

## A little bit each day! [Slack Post, Friday 10/18, 10:57am](https://ucsb-cs156-f24.slack.com/archives/C07FDC0U6DS/p1729274275308369)

A general bit of advice:

This is a course where doing “a little bit each day” works a lot better than planning a last minute push the day before something is due.  

The reason is that you tend to run into problems that require checking in with folks, so doing 30 minutes per day for 5 days (2.5 hours total) is a lot more effective than doing 5 hours on the last day (twice as much time); you just get more done, because in between you can check in with folks to ask for help on things you are stuck on.

So let me encourage you: set a 30 minute timer, and try to do at least 30 minutes of work on team01 each day between now and this coming Tuesday.  

If/when you run into problems, post to your team channel first (since everyone on your team is doing pretty much the “same but different, but also sort of the same” assignment.)  

If they don’t know then try `#help-team01`.
